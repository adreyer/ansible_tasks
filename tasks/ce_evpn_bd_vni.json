An AS number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535, and a user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 4294967295. The AS and user-defined numbers cannot be both 0s. This means that an RD cannot be 0:0. 2) Integral 4-byte AS number:2-byte user-defined number, for example, 65537:3. An AS number is an integer ranging from 65536 to 4294967295, and a user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535. 3) 4-byte AS number in dotted notation:2-byte user-defined number, for example, 0.0:3 or 0.1:0. A 4-byte AS number in dotted notation is in the format of x.y, where x and y are integers ranging from 0 to 65535. 4) A user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535. The AS and user-defined numbers cannot be both 0s. This means that an RD cannot be 0.0:0. 5) 32-bit IP address:2-byte user-defined number. For example, 192.168.122.15:1. An IP address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, and a user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535. 6) 'auto' specifies the RD that is automatically generated."
