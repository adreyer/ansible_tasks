  "description": "This module allows you to work with switch configurations. It provides a way to back up the running or startup configurations of a switch to a remote server. This is achieved by periodically saving a copy of the startup or running configuration of the network device to a remote server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first step is to create a directory from where the remote server can be reached. The next step is to provide the full file path of the location where the configuration will be backed up. Authentication details required by the remote server must be provided as well. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.
