  "description": "This module allows you to work with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) related configurations. The operators used are overloaded to ensure control over switch BGP configurations. This module is invoked using method with asNumber as one of its arguments. The first level of the BGP configuration allows to set up an AS number, with the following attributes going into various configuration operations under the context of BGP. After passing this level, there are eight BGP arguments that will perform further configurations. They are bgpArg1, bgpArg2, bgpArg3, bgpArg4, bgpArg5, bgpArg6, bgpArg7, and bgpArg8. For more details on how to use these arguments, see [Overloaded Variables]. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.
