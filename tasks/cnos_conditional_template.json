  "description": "This module allows you to work with the running configuration of a switch. It provides a way to execute a set of CNOS commands on a switch by evaluating the current running configuration and executing the commands only if the specific settings have not been already configured. The configuration source can be a set of commands or a template written in the Jinja2 templating language. This module functions the same as the cnos_template module. The only exception is that the following inventory variable can be specified [\u201ccondition = <flag string>\u201d] When this inventory variable is specified as the variable of a task, the template is executed for the network element that matches the flag string. Usually, templates are used when commands are the same across a group of network devices. When there is a requirement to skip the execution of the template on one or more devices, it is recommended to use this module. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.
