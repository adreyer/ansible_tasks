  "description": "This module allows you to work with switch firmware images. It provides a way to download a firmware image to a network device from a remote server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first step is to create a directory from where the remote server can be reached. The next step is to provide the full file path of the image\u2019s location. Authentication details required by the remote server must be provided as well. By default, this method makes the newly downloaded firmware image the active image, which will be used by the switch during the next restart. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.
