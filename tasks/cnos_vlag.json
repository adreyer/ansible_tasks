  "description": "This module allows you to work with virtual Link Aggregation Groups (vLAG) related configurations. The operators used are overloaded to ensure control over switch vLAG configurations. Apart from the regular device connection related attributes, there are four vLAG arguments which are overloaded variables that will perform further configurations. They are vlagArg1, vlagArg2, vlagArg3, and vlagArg4. For more details on how to use these arguments, see [Overloaded Variables]. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run. For more information about this module from Lenovo and customizing it usage for your use cases, please visit U(http://systemx.lenovofiles.com/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.lenovo.switchmgt.ansible.doc%2Fcnos_vlag.html)",
