  "description": "This module allows you to work with VLAN related configurations. The operators used are overloaded to ensure control over switch VLAN configurations. The first level of VLAN configuration allows to set up the VLAN range, the VLAN tag persistence, a VLAN access map and access map filter. After passing this level, there are five VLAN arguments that will perform further configurations. They are vlanArg1, vlanArg2, vlanArg3, vlanArg4, and vlanArg5. The value of vlanArg1 will determine the way following arguments will be evaluated. For more details on how to use these arguments, see [Overloaded Variables]. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run.
