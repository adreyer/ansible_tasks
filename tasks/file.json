One example are docker mounted files, they cannot be updated atomically and can only be done in an unsafe manner. This boolean option allows ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files for those cases in which you do not have any other choice. Be aware that this is subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption."

Use C(hard) for hardlinks. If C(absent), directories will be recursively deleted, and files or symlinks will be unlinked. Note that C(file) will not fail if the C(path) does not exist as the state did not change.
