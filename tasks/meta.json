      "description": "This module takes a free form command, as a string. There's not an actual option named \"free form\".  See the examples! C(flush_handlers) makes Ansible run any handler tasks which have thus far been notified. Ansible inserts these tasks internally at certain points to implicitly trigger handler runs (after pre/post tasks, the final role execution, and the main tasks section of your plays).\n C(refresh_inventory) (added in 2.0) forces the reload of the inventory, which in the case of dynamic inventory scripts means they will be re-executed. This is mainly useful when additional hosts are created and users wish to use them instead of using the `add_host` module.\"\n C(noop) (added in 2.0) This literally does 'nothing'. It is mainly used internally and not recommended for general use. C(clear_facts) (added in 2.1) causes the gathered facts for the hosts specified in the play's list of hosts to be cleared, including the fact cache. C(clear_host_errors) (added in 2.1) clears the failed state (if any) from hosts specified in the play's list of hosts. C(end_play) (added in 2.2) causes the play to end without failing the host. C(reset_connection) (added in 2.3) interrupts a persistent connection (i.e. ssh + control persist)"
