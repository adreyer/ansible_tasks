C(channels) is name of channel from which event handler is waiting for events. C(event) is type of event which is able to trigger event handler: I(js-before-publish), I(js-after-publish), I(js-after-presence). Each entry for existing handlers should contain C(name) (so target handler can be identified). Rest parameters (C(src), C(channels) and C(event)) can be added if changes required for them. It is possible to rename event handler by adding C(changes) key to event handler payload and pass dictionary, which will contain single key C(name), where new name should be passed. To remove particular event handler it is possible to set C(state) for it to C(absent) and it will be removed."
