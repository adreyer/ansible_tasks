In 1.8 and above, ansible adapts to the new slack API where tokens look like C(G922VJP24/D921DW937/3Ffe373sfhRE6y42Fg3rvf4GlK).  If tokens are in the new format then slack will ignore any value of domain.  If the token is in the old format the domain is required.  Ansible has no control of when slack will get rid of the old API.  When slack does that the old format will stop working.  ** Please keep in mind the tokens are not the API tokens but are the webhook tokens.  In slack these are found in the webhook URL which are obtained under the apps and integrations. The incoming webhooks can be added in that area.  In some cases this may be locked by your Slack admin and you must request access.  It is there that the incoming webhooks can be added.  The key is on the end of the URL given to you in that section."
