When multiple elements are included in the list (and C(state) is C(present)), the elements are guaranteed to appear in the same relative order in the resultant path value. Variable expansions (eg, C(%VARNAME%)) are allowed, and are stored unexpanded in the target path element. Any existing path elements not mentioned in C(elements) are always preserved in their current order. New path elements are appended to the path, and existing path elements may be moved closer to the end to satisfy the requested ordering. Paths are compared in a case-insensitive fashion, and trailing backslashes are ignored for comparison purposes. However, note that trailing backslashes in YAML require quotes."
